**Robustness Evaluation for Self-supervised Learning Methods**

This repository evaluates rbosutness of self-supervised learning methods for out-of-distribution samples, algorithmically generated corruptions (blur, noise) applied to the ImageNet test-set. analysis is carried out for qualitatively and quantitatively.

*Evaluation dataset (all corruptions, all difficulty levels)* - ImageNet-C, [link](https://zenodo.org/record/2235448#.ZA4ct3bMI2w)
